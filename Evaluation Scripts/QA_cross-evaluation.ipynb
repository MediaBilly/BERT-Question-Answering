The kick-off to start a game is awarded to the team that lost the pre-game coin toss (the team that won the coin-toss chooses which direction they wish to play). The kick-off begins when the referee blows the whistle. The kick-off to start the second half is taken by the other team. If extra time is played another coin-toss is used at the beginning of this period.</td>\n","      <td>[34, 32]</td>\n","      <td>[43, 43]</td>\n","      <td>[the team that lost the pre - game coin toss, awarded to the team that lost the pre - game coin toss]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>mount everest how did it get its name</td>\n","      <td>[nan]</td>\n","      <td>In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society, upon a recommendation by Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India.

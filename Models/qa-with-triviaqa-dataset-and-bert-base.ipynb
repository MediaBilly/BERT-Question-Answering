The game is played by the players alternating turns tossing horseshoes at stakes in the ground , which are traditionally placed 40 ft apart . Modern games use a more stylized U-shaped bar , about twice the size of an actual horseshoe . \\n \\n Game play \\n \\n Official Rules of the Game of Horseshoes from the NHPA \\n \\n The Nati...   \n\n       ans_start_tok  ans_end_tok    ans_tok_text  \n0                512          512                  \n1                512          512                  \n2                512          512                  \n3                 17           17           exile  \n4                486          486          cancer  \n...              ...          ...             ...  \n14224              2            3  national guard  \n14225             39           40          grinch  \n14226            399          399           brown  \n14227            449          449           brown  \n14228              1            2      horseshoes  \n\n[14229 rows x 7 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>index</th>\n      <th>question</th>\n      <th>answer</th>\n      <th>corpus</th>\n      <th>ans_start_tok</th>\n      <th>ans_end_tok</th>\n      <th>ans_tok_text</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>Which Lloyd Webber musical premiered in the US on 10th December 1993?</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>Andrew Lloyd Webber , Baron Lloyd-Webber ( born 22 March 1948 ) is an English composer and impresario of musical theatre . \\n \\n Several of his musicals have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway .
